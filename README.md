## 🚀 Project Overview

AI Code Reviewer is a full-stack web application that allows developers to upload their source code (e.g., JavaScript, Python) and receive **instant AI-powered feedback** on bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and code quality. The core analysis is driven by large language models (LLMs), making it easy to get actionable code review insights without manual intervention.
